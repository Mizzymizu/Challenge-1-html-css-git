# Challenge-1-html-css-git

## Description
This repository was made to complete Challenge-1 for the Bootcamp. It contains a webpage that was refactored to allow the website to be more accessible for all users.

I had also refactored the code to follow a more semantic HTML flow with a few changes to the CSS for it to work properly with the new HTML attributes that were added.

I had also commented on both the .html and .css file the changes I had made.

Please check it out! This was a really interesting way to put into practice what I've learned so far in the UTSA Coding Bootcamp!
